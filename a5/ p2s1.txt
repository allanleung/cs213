The initial problem was pop was freeing the element and trying to return e->name

Secondly, main() was allocating a char pointer to W and pop, which returns a string.

Pop was constantly free(e), leaving all the elements dangling.

I solved it by first allocating a space in main that is static, which temporary holds the char

Then pass a char pointer in pop and have the main return the char instead of the pop function.

I change the pop function to return void and change the return statement to nothing.
