So from my understanding, element_t is used everywhere. 

This makes it impossible to know who is using since it gets called everywhere.

I fixed by adding the int reference in the struct, finished the two function inc_ref
and dec_ref. I went to list.h, follow the instruction on where to add inc_ref and 
dec_ref to the code.
