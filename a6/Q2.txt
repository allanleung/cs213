a) S7-static-call-stack uses a stack to keep track of the return pointers. 
   S7-static-call-regs just keeps the return pointer in a register.

b) The stack allows for more complex programs. Other methods or function can also use the value in the stack if they wish
   The stack also has more space than if the computer have lots of memory where as reg only has 8.

c) Register is more efficient for small programs since it doesn't require an extra read and write to memory. 
   Register is also faster than memory.
